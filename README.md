# Spider Web (a bad Web Crawler)

A mock web crawler designed to demonstrate the difficulties that might come as a result of
using Puns or Metaphors as class names or variables.

Even with adequate documentation, these end up resulting in an undiscoverable API at best and often unintended code obfuscation at worst. These also have the added effect of leading to bikeshedding discussions centered around an accurate application of the metaphor as opposed to actually solving the problem at hand. 

TL;DR this is not a best practice and should be avoided.
